# Soft Skillet Analysis Flowchart and Outline

## Description [hypothetical scenario]

This document outlines my approach to analyzing Soft Skillet's sales data and call recordings to develop actionable recommendations aimed at increasing the adoption of the reservations product among restaurants in Santa Barbara, CA. I plan to thoroughly examine the provided dataset to identify patterns, trends, and key metrics such as conversion rates, pitch effectiveness, and customer segments. Additionally, I will analyze the call recordings to understand the sales approaches used, the responses from prospects, objections raised, and the outcomes of each call.

By integrating insights from both the data and the call recordings, I aim to determine which sales pitches are most effective and why, as well as identify any gaps or opportunities in the current sales strategy. The flowchart below summarizes the steps I will take in my analysis, demonstrating key traits such as curiosity, initiative, comfort with ambiguity, creativity, and reasoning.

My goal is to develop tailored recommendations that focus on pitches resonating with different types of restaurants, enhance sales strategies through training and sharing best practices, suggest product improvements based on customer feedback, and explore opportunities for market expansion. I will support my recommendations with data-driven insights and estimate the potential impact on adoption rates and return on investment.

By addressing any uncertainties and demonstrating critical thinking, I intend to propose solutions for any data limitations and challenge existing strategies to consider alternative approaches. Showcasing creativity and initiative, I will incorporate external insights about restaurant industry trends in Santa Barbara and benchmark Soft Skillet's strategies against competitors to highlight areas for differentiation.
